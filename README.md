# Hannah's Portfolio

## Description

This is my personal portfolio. I created it to have a personal and profesional place to store and show off my projects. My motivation was to try and showcase my strong suits and dedication to the new career choice i have made. I wanted to also wanted to track my oldest (worst) to new and and improved coding skills I will gain over time. This will allow future employers to view (hopefully be impressed) and potentally hire me. Throughout this challenge I learned about starting code from scratch, implementing cleaning up repetative code, and linking not just images but buttons to other classes.
